# IUA-Channel: "If unsure ask ..." An alternative to explicit Responsibilities.

I like central corporate [Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki). It helps to find a common terminology.

Here comes a story. 

I have seen this several times: A co-worker (Bob) created a cool tool. Then I would like to create a new wiki page explaining this
cool thing. The Bob likes this idea. He is busy doing things, so he is happy that I want to document it. And I am happy since I like to improve our knowledge base.

Me: Hi Bob, I would like to create a little wiki page about your cool tool. 

Bob: Yes, great. Thank you.

Me: Bob, are you okay with me writing on the wiki page that you are responsible for this?

Bob: hmmm, I don't know. 

In other words, he is not comfortable with it.

Background: I am not the manager of Bob. We work on eye-level (peer-to-peer). Nobody told me to care for the wiki. I do it to make life easier for new comers and people from other departments.

My first step was okay for Bob: Create a page where every employee can read about the cool new tool. But he does not like the second step. Why?

Inspired by the book [Brave New Work](https://www.bravenewwork.com/) by Aaron Dignan I realized: Org-Charts and official "Responsibilities" are less important today. 

"You are responsible for xyz" is roughly the same as "You are to blame if something goes wrong."

There are different kinds of people. Some are brave super-heroes. And most are not. That's ok. I am not a brave super-hero, too. I don't want to be the one to blame, although I like to build stuff which makes customers or colleagues happy.

Bob created something new because it was useful. He wanted to solve something which helps now and today. He does not want to be the one to blame if this does not work two years later. That's understandable.

Nevertheless, I still have the new wiki page before me which explains the basics of the new tool.

How to proceed? Just close it, docuemnt the tool and don't mention a name on the page?

What is my goal? I have this scene on my mind: A new team member heard about this tool. He finds the wiki page and he learns the basic facts about the cool tool. But he wants to know more about a particular detail. Or he wants to improve it, or he just wants to says "thank you for this tool".

I want to help the new team member to learn the basics fast. There is no need to explain every detail on the wiki page. Just an overview. And if this new team member has a question, he should know where to ask.

Bob, the creator of the tool, is in the "getting things done" mode. He does not see that it makes sense to document and advertise his tool. And that's all right.

If "responsible" does not fit. Which alternatives exist?

In an Org-Chart there is a line between two boxes. Imagine there are two boxes A and B. How to call the line between A and B?

* A is responsible for B
* A is accountable for B
* A manages B
* A owns B
* B reports to A

The attentive reader might notice that I don't make a distinction between what A or B is. It could be a person, a role,
a department, a team, a tool, a service ...

There was a time when I was new and completely clueless. I remember this very well.

For example when I tried to compile the Linux kernel for the first time. In 1997 this was common practice and done
by most Linux users. I was completely lost. A lot of unknown tech terms faced me and great search engines like Bing (and Google) were
not invented yet. Before compiling the kernel a lot of questions got asked interactively. 

I am very thankful for the kernel hacker who had the idea to put a [sane default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(computer_science)) option called "if unsure choose ..." to every question.

Since I had no clue, this hint helped me do manage this complicated process.

23 years later (some days ago) I read about [Direct Responsible Individual (Apple)](https://fortune.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/).
I think this is a good solution for temporary projects. For a time-frame of two weeks to maybe eight months, it is easy to say "Yes, I want to be a directly responsible individual."

But back to me sitting in front of the screen creating a new wiki page. This is not a temporary project.
This is a tool/service/process that will last longer. No end in sight so far. Going to our manager to solve this would make
it too complicated. This should be doable on the peer-to-peer level.

Thank you for your patience in reading my story.

... short dramaturgical pause ... 

The solution: **IUA-Channel: If unsure ask ...**

More is not needed. Newcomers should know whom to talk to.

The IUA-Channel can be a person, a role, a chat-channel or a mail-address.

Obvious? Yes, now it is obvious and simple.

You could call it "Contact-Channel" or "Support-Channel". But this wouldn't be new, cool, agile, lean or innovative :-)

What do you think about this? Please write me a mail guettli.iua@thomas-guettler.de or create an issue at GitHub.

Please tell me typos or strange wordings, I am not a native speaker.

## Different perspectives

### I don't get the problem you want to solve with IUA

I want to raise obviousness to make the work environment more efficient. This is hard to grasp. Raising
obviousness means to change thousand small things, and at the end nobody will notice a difference. It will
just work.

A comparison: At the watercooler a common topic are the traffic jams created by road construction works. People need to wait,
and this annoys them. Since they are annoyed they start to speak. That's a common pattern for the species homo sapiens.
If the road is fine, then they complain about the weather. They don't even realize that the roads are in a very good
state.

If you look at this comparison, then you realize: You can raise obviousness and make work easier, and finally nobody 
will say "thank you". That's live. Don't expect a "thank you". Do it since you see that it makes sense.

### No template/guideline

The real issue is that there is no template or guideline for the Wiki. If there is a clear description of
what is neede per page, then this issue would be simpler.

### Let it flow - there is no issue

Relax, if Bob does not want his name to be on the wiki page, then don't write his name there. End of story.

If the reader of the page has an issue, since he does not know whom to contact, then it is the issue of the reader. Not mine. Maybe there will never be a reader with the question "Who can I ask about this tool?".

## Alternatives to IUA-Channels

### RACI Matrix

[Responsibility assignment matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix)

Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.

IUA is about "consulted". Who can I consult, if I need advice. This can get solved at peer-to-peer level and is very helpful.

### Asset Management / iso9001

[Asset Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management): 

> Asset management refers to systematic approach to the governance and realization of value from the things that a 
> group or entity is responsible for, over their whole life cycles. It may apply both to tangible assets 
> (physical objects such as buildings or equipment) and to intangible assets (such as human capital, 
> intellectual property, goodwill or financial assets). Asset management is a systematic process of developing, 
> operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets in the most cost-effective manner (including 
> all costs, risks and performance attributes).

## Ownership.

This term gets used often. For example: [10 Ways to Encourage Employees to Take Ownership in Their Work](https://ericchester.com/10-ways-encourage-employees-to-take-ownership-at-work/)

Companies want it, but does the term "Ownership" really fit here?

Just have a look at the Wikpedia page: [Ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership).

You can own a car, a house, land or real estate ...

You can take ownership of things you created, hen "take ownership" means "build new things". This fits
to a fast growint startup.

But in an established company "take ownership" would mean to take it away from somebody. This is like stealing.

## What is better than having two contact channels?

> What is better than having two contact channels?

Answer: To have **one** contact channel.

Why: Because "don't make me think". If you have two contact channels, then you need to think. You need
to decide which contact channel to choose.

Keep it simple.

## Conclusion

I think there are three levels of "Responsibility":

* Org Chart: This is the official Responsibility. You can't take ownership here on your own.
* DRI (Direct responsible individual): For temporary project, an individual who has the final word fits well. This way decisions get done fast and without long discussions.
* Support-Channel: Long-lasting support for a process or tool.  A group of people fits well. It is more about being available if there is a question. After talking to your peers you can take ownership on your own.
