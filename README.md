# IUA: If unsure ask ... An alternative to "Responsiblities"

I like central coperate [Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki). It helps to find a common terminology.

I have seen this several times: A co-worker (Bob) created a cool thing. Then I would like to create a new wiki page explaining this
cool thing. The co-worker likes this idea.

In the past I asked: Bob, are you okay with me writing in the wiki page that you are responsible for this?

Bob: hmmm, I don't know. 

With other words, he is not realy comfortable with it.

Background: I am not the manager of Bob. We work on eye-level (peer-to-peer).

Inspired by the book [Brave New Work](https://www.bravenewwork.com/) by Aaron Dignan I realized: Org-Charts and "Responsibilties"
are less important today. 

"You are responsible for xyz" this roughly is the same as "You are to blame, if xyz goes wrong."

There are different kind of people. Some are brave super-heros. And most are not. That's ok. I am not a brave super-hero, too. And I don't want to be the one to blame

Bob created something new because it was useful. He wanted to solve something which helps now and today. He does not want to be
the one to blame if this does not work two years later. That's obvious.

Nevertheless I have the new wiki page before me which explains the basics of the new tool.

How to proceed?

What is my goal? My goal: If a new team member heard about this tool, I want to help him to learn the basics fast. I
don't want to explain every detail of this new tool. Just an overview. And if this new team member has a question, he
should know where to ask.

If "resonsible" does not fit. Which alternatives exist?

In an Org-Chart there is a line between to boxes. Imagine there are two boxes A and B. How to call the line between A and B?

* A is accountable for B
* A manages B
* A owns B
* B reports to B

The attentive reader might noticed that I don't make a distinction what A or B is. It could be a person, a role,
a department, a team, a tool, a service ...

There was a time, when I was new and completely clueless. I remeber this very well.

This was when I tried to compile the Linux kernel for the first time on my own. In 1997 this was common practice and done
by most linux users. I was completely lost. A lot of unknown tech terms faced me and and great search engines like Bing where
not invented yet. Before compiling the kernel a lot of questions got asked interactively. 

I am very thankful for the kernel hacker who had the idea to put a "if unsure choose ..." to  every question.

Since I had no clue, this hint helped me do manage this process.

Some days ago I read about [Direct Responsible Individual (Apple)](https://fortune.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/).
I think this is a good solution for temporary projects. For a time-frame of two weeks to three months it is easy to say "Yes, 
I want to be the direct responsible individual."

But back to me sitting in front of the screen creating a new wiki page. This is not a temporary project.
This is a tool/service/process which lasts longer. No end in sight so far. Going to our manager to solve this would make
it too complicated. This should be doable on peer-to-peer level.

Thank your for your patience reading my story.

... short dramatic pause ... 

The solution: **IUA: If unsure ask ...**

More is not needed. A new comers should know where to ask questions which are not solved on the wiki-page.

This `...` can be a person, a role, a chat-channel or a mail-adress.

Obvious? Yes, now it is obvious and simple.

What do you think about this? Please write me a mail guettli.iua@thomas-guettler.de or create an issue at github.
