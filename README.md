# IUA: If unsure ask ... An alternative to "Responsiblities"

I like central coperate [Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki). It helps to find a common terminology.

I have seen this several times: A co-worker (Bob) created a cool thing. Then I would like to create a new wiki page explaining this
cool thing. The co-worker likes this idea.

In the past I asked: Bob, are you okay with me writing in the wiki page that you are responsible for this?

Bob: hmmm, I don't know. 

With other words: I is not realy comfortable with it.

Background: I am not the manager of Bob. We work on eye-level (peer-to-peer).

Inspired by the book [Brave New Work](https://www.bravenewwork.com/) by Aaron Dignan I realized: Org-Charts and "Responsibilties"
are less important today. 

"You are responsible for xyz" this roughly the same as "You are to blame, if xyz goes wrong."

There are different kind of people. Some are brave super-heros. And most are not. That's ok. I am not a brave super-hero, too.
And I don't want to be one.

Bob created something new because it was useful. He wanted to solve something which helps now and today. I does not want to be
the one to blame if this does not work two years later. That's obvious.

Nevertheless I have the new wiki page before me and documented the basics of the new tool.

How to proceed?

If "resonsible" does not fit. Which alternatives exist?

In an Org-Chart there is a line between to boxes. Imagine there are two boxes A and B. How to call the line between A and B?

* A is accountable for B
* A manages B
* A owns B
* B reports to B

The attentive reader might noticed that I don't make a distinction what A or B is. It could be a person, a role,
a department, a team, a tool, a service ...

There was a time, when I was new and completely clueless. I remeber this very well.

This was when I tried to compile the Linux kernel for the first time on my own. In 1997 this was common practice and done
by most linux users. I was completely lost. A lot of unknown tech terms faced me and and great search engines like Bing where
not invented yet. Before compiling the kernel a lot of questions got asked interactively. 

I am very thankful for the kernel hacker who had the idea to put a "if unsure choose ..." to  every question.

Since I had no clue, this hint helped me do manage this process.

Some days ago I read about [Direct Responsible Individual (Apple)](https://fortune.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/).
I think this is a good solution for temporary projects. For a time-frame of two weeks to three months it is easy to say "Yes, I
I want to be the direct responsible individual.

But back to me sitting in front of the screen creating a new wiki page. This is not a temporary project.
This is something which tool/service/process which lasts longer. No end in sight so far.

Thank your for your patience.

The solution I prefer at the moment is called: **IUA: If unsure ask ...**

This `...` can be a person, a role, a chat-channel or a mail-adress.

Obvious? Yes, now it is obvious and simple.
