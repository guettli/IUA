# IUA-Channel: "If unsure ask ..." An alternative to explicit Responsibilities.

I like central corporate [Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki). It helps to find a common terminology.

I have seen this several times: A co-worker (Bob) created a cool thing. Then I would like to create a new wiki page explaining this
cool thing. The co-worker likes this idea.

I asked: Bob, are you okay with me writing on the wiki page that you are responsible for this?

Bob: hmmm, I don't know. 

In other words, he is not comfortable with it.

Background: I am not the manager of Bob. We work on eye-level (peer-to-peer). Nobody told me to care for the wiki. It's my hobby. I hope it helps beginners. That's why I like to do it.

My first step was okay for Bob: Create a page where every employee can read about the cool new tool. But he does not like the second step. Why?

Inspired by the book [Brave New Work](https://www.bravenewwork.com/) by Aaron Dignan I realized: Org-Charts and "Responsibilities"
are less important today. 

"You are responsible for xyz" this roughly is the same as "You are to blame if xyz goes wrong."

There are different kinds of people. Some are brave super-heroes. And most are not. That's ok. I am not a brave super-hero, too. And I don't want to be the one to blame. 

Bob created something new because it was useful. He wanted to solve something which helps now and today. He does not want to be
the one to blame if this does not work two years later. That's understandable.

Nevertheless, I still have the new wiki page before me which explains the basics of the new tool.

How to proceed? Just close it, and don't mention a name on the page?

What is my goal? I have this scene on my mind: A new team member heard about this tool. He finds the wiki page and he learns the basic facts about the cool tool. But he wants to know more about a particular detail. Or he wants to improve it, or he just wants to says "thank you for this tool".

I want to help the new team member to learn the basics fast. There is no need to explain every detail on the wiki page. Just an overview. And if this new team member has a question, he should know where to ask.

If "responsible" does not fit. Which alternatives exist?

In an Org-Chart there is a line between two boxes. Imagine there are two boxes A and B. How to call the line between A and B?

* A is responsible for B
* A is accountable for B
* A manages B
* A owns B
* B reports to A

The attentive reader might notice that I don't make a distinction between what A or B is. It could be a person, a role,
a department, a team, a tool, a service ...

There was a time when I was new and completely clueless. I remember this very well.

This was when I tried to compile the Linux kernel for the first time on my own. In 1997 this was common practice and done
by most Linux users. I was completely lost. A lot of unknown tech terms faced me and great search engines like Bing were
not invented yet. Before compiling the kernel a lot of questions got asked interactively. 

I am very thankful for the kernel hacker who had the idea to put a [sane default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(computer_science)) option called "if unsure choose ..." to every question.

Since I had no clue, this hint helped me do manage this complicated process.

Some days ago I read about [Direct Responsible Individual (Apple)](https://fortune.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/).
I think this is a good solution for temporary projects. For a time-frame of two weeks to maybe eight months, it is easy to say "Yes, I want to be a directly responsible individual."

But back to me sitting in front of the screen creating a new wiki page. This is not a temporary project.
This is a tool/service/process that will last longer. No end in sight so far. Going to our manager to solve this would make
it too complicated. This should be doable on the peer-to-peer level.

Thank you for your patience in reading my story.

... short dramaturgical pause ... 

The solution: **IUA-Channel: If unsure ask ...**

More is not needed. Newcomers should know whom to talk to.

The IUA-Channel can be a person, a role, a chat-channel or a mail-address.

Obvious? Yes, now it is obvious and simple.

You could call it "Contact-Channel" or "Support-Channel". But this wouldn't be new, cool, agile, lean or innovative :-)

What do you think about this? Please write me a mail guettli.iua@thomas-guettler.de or create an issue at GitHub.

Please tell me typos or strange wordings, I am not a native speaker.

## Alternatives

### RACI Matrix

[Responsibility assignment matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix)

Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.

IUA is about "consulted". Who can I consult, if I need advice. This can get solved at peer-to-peer level and is very helpful.

## Conclusion

I think there are three levels of "Responsibility":

* Org Chart: This is the official Responsibility. You can't take ownership here on your own.
* DRI (Direct responsible individual): For temporary project. An individual who has the final word fits well.
* Support-Channel: Long-lasting support for a process or tool. You can take ownership on your own. A group of people fits well. It is more about being available if there is a question.
